# Finding shortest path in a mall with PHP

I created this project for an interview.

A mall has Kiosks that show you how to get where you want to go. By using these Kiosks, you can learn how to get to the store you want from your current location. There may be more than one floor, store in the mall. Some points may be closed for reasons such as cleaning and renovation. Stairs or elevators can be used on the way. We keep all these dynamically in the database and find out which method to go in the shortest way with the shortest path finding algorithm.

There may be errors in the codes, I may not have thought of some cases, so bugs may appear. So you can develop the code the way you want and then make it easier for students or recent graduates to use it.

MySQL files are in the project, after creating a database named "kiosk_project", you can use all sqldump files by importing them.

Hope it helps someone <3
